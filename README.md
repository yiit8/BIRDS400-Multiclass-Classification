# BIRDS400 Multiclass Classification


Using https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species dataset i tried to predict bird species

Results are okay but not great. In terms of time management i had to use small batch size and low epoch iteration
# ----------------------------------
There is a quick demo below to demonstrate the local app
